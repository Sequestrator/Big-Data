QUERIES WE WILL NEED TO EXECUTE
1. What flights have availability between any two given cities in a certain date range.
2. What flights are overbooked either by a destination city or an arrival city in a certain
date range.
3. What city has the highest demand (demand is the percentage of possible seats
originating in a city that are sold) in a given date range or on a given day of week
4. Conversely what city has the lowest demand.
5. What destination city has the most available inbound seats in a given date range.
6. List by airline and day of week, how many total miles are flown by that airline
7. What is the average number of flights and miles flown by all travelers, by the top n
travelers, by the top n% travelers. For the later two, what is the percentage of total flights and total miles that these travelers represent.


//when you design relationally, you care about structure, not about what queries will be.
//complexity of queries --> nosql

Start with queries, build documents that you need, then go to schema for info.
