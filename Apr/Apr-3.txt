In 2010, the us Census said there were about 300,000,000 us citizens.
	- US airline embarcations was about 600,000,000
		600,000,000/365 = 1,600,000
			1,600,000/8084 = 33,000 tickets per hour
				33,000/60 = 555 tickets per minute
					555/60 = 10 tickets a second
					
					Mike/Wife/Daughter did 13 searches to purchase 1 round trip ticket.
					~130 search transactions per second.
				~100,000 flights per day.

Each one of these shards is made up of chunks. And it attempts to relocate chunks as it sees necessary.
Each one of the shards means an instance of mongod, i.e a physical machine.
Since each one is a replication set, it is possible that they are in multiple locations.
provide the address of one of the mongod serves, that server will respond to the client, showing that we are
rep sets for these other servers. It is how we maintain connectivity, even if we lose one of the servers.

We hae an additional replicationset. Holds information regarding the sharding. Keys and ranges that all map to the seperate
chunks. That is the job of mongos, not mongod.

Lets start an aggregation with a 
$match, and the $lookup

$match = find
say we $lookup by school

id = 1
people.state = univ.state ==> univ.state = IN
