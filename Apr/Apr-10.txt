4/10 Notes

Run an own server for creating clusters. Got 3 servers and created replication sets
To run a cluster, it generally requires 9 machines. There will be 1 replication set that contains ADMIN.config
That requires its own Replication set, + odd number of servers. 3 servers Run the config, each shard has 3 servers.

MongoAtlas - Hosted mongo clusters. Runs on amazon.

Running a cluster with 2 shards. Each shard has a Primary and 2 Secondaries. With Atlas, we dont get GeoDistribution.

To connect, there are a bunch of different ways. Our way is very Secure. Must provide an IP address to connect.
Currently it is broadcast to the entire network.

Admin.config
User: cs473
Pass: ButlerDawgz
Host: cs473-shard-00-00-7choh.mongodb.net
Port: 37017

S4 S5 S6 - RS2
S7 S8 S9 - RS1 (mongoD and mongoS)

S1 S2 S3 - configdb
mongod = port 27017
mongos = port 37017
If we shard by zip code, shards will distribute evenly, and when connect to S4, then only will see the Zips to that shard.
