Mapping between collections and Mongodb

Lets say we have 2 collections
{C}People
	-id
	-name
	-age
	-(employeerID) or ***@Embedded (id, name)*** (References everything)
	{
		-addressOne
		-city
		-state
	}
{C}Employeer
	-id
	-name

In people we want to reference employeer

Now in Java

People.class
{
	String id
	String name
	String age
	String employeeriD (Just the ID)
	Employeer employeer (@Embedded Document)
	***Location location*** (Only Referenced Once, Reliant on Query)
}

Location.class
{
	addressOne
	city
	state
}

sh.enableSharding("Database")
mongos sh.shardCollection("database.airline, {id: "hashed"})

if we shard an 1000000 document collection, it will not be balanced as it moves stuff from system to system

What to do on monday. Review what the data model is and do the queries.

What to prepare for.

We need to tell mike how to shard the database.

Shard this collection, on any field, and I want it ranged/hashed
