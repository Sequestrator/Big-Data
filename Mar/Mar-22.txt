Time Series Data

If we were all together and we id analysis on birthdate, its interesting in time, but not a time series event.

instances of birth from the US in real time that would be Time Series.

Utility data information. Not 1 a month, how much energy are you using instantly at any given meter.

if we measure energy data per minute, how would we timestamp this.

Interesting Challenge:

1 Document - 
TimeS: 3:00:00
TimeE: 3:59:00
Date: 3/17/17
Measurements: [0...59]

2 Document - 
TimeS: 4:00:00
TimeE: 4:59:00
Date: 3/17/17
Measurements: [0...59]

Everytime this happens, we do a write. One of mongos core caps is the in-place update mechanism field-level updates are managed in place
as long as the size of the doc does not grow significantly.

As long as the doc doesnt move, we dont have to touch the index. In place update is pretty quick
if we insert every time, every index needs to be updated on every insert.

If we periodically update, then instead of constant updates, we just actually write to it
when we need it. 

so if we unwind on the 60 Measurements......
we will now have 60 documents of the form {3:00:00, 3:59:00, 3/17/17, #} 

could $skip && $limit, or do includeArrayIndex: <string>

365 days, 24 docs/day, 1mil ppl.
