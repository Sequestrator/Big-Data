No class 3/20
Now that we know how to design a db, lets make one

Morphia @ mongodb
1 class per collection

Sample Morphia Doc

@Entity("employees")
@Indexes
(
    @Index(value = "salary", fields = @Field("salary"))
)
class Employee 
{
    @Id
    private ObjectId id;
    private String name;
    
    @Reference
    private Employee manager;
    
    @Reference
    private List<Employee> directReports;
    
    @Property("wage")
    private Double salary;
}

Must create mapping classes that correlate Java code to DB code

App:
Loads 10 dox
Queries Them
Prints Results

Mapping Classes:

Mongo Server:
Migrate to a cluster with shards (one of the first)
